<h1> Motivations and Goals </h1>

In our day to day life we felt the need of a digital universaity portal system where we can get daily updates of educational, official, cultural and organizations. The updates of daily essentials were scattered and unorganized also there were any organized collections of educational materials before.
So we thought of a platform where daily updates of university also a collective archieve of educational materials would be found togather in a single place. Our goal is to provide seamless updates of our campus and educational materials like class notes, previous years questions.
We also added a page for posting blogs about our campus culture and history that will represent our achievements and goals.
